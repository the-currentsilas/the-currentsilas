<h1>THE-CURRENTSILAS</h1>
<p>Welcome to my profile! I do random shit that makes no sense.<br>I'm a relatively interesting person, and I am really stupid.</p>
<p>I can't do many things, but here's a handy list:</p>
<p>-Draw decent art (I do not do commisions so don't even bother)<br>-Code in HTML, alongside with Lua.<br>-Make lore with characters that don't really have any.</p>
